# Price-signal and construction activity
Markets are a decentralize way to allocate ressources, allocation that is often deemed to be the most efficient one compared to its alternative. Indeed, market efficiencies stem from a key feature of them : prices. According to Hayek and the Autrichian school, prices indicates a high level of demand and a low level if supply. According to this theory, one would expect construction activity to happen where demand is high, i.e. where supply is scarce. 
Intuitions that were later formalized by neoclassical economists
This data science project aim to give material to the question : is decentralized supply of housing and non residential building efficient ? 
Framed differently : do markets build where buildings would be needed ?
